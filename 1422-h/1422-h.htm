<h1>GOING INTO SOCIETY</h1>
<p>At one period of its reverses, the House fell into the occupation
of a Showman.&nbsp; He was found registered as its occupier, on the
parish books of the time when he rented the House, and there was therefore
no need of any clue to his name.&nbsp; But, he himself was less easy
to be found; for, he had led a wandering life, and settled people had
lost sight of him, and people who plumed themselves on being respectable
were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him.&nbsp;
At last, among the marsh lands near the river&rsquo;s level, that lie
about Deptford and the neighbouring market-gardens, a Grizzled Personage
in velveteen, with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he
looked as if he had been tattooed, was found smoking a pipe at the door
of a wooden house on wheels.&nbsp; The wooden house was laid up in ordinary
for the winter, near the mouth of a muddy creek; and everything near
it, the foggy river, the misty marshes, and the steaming market-gardens,
smoked in company with the grizzled man.&nbsp; In the midst of this
smoking party, the funnel-chimney of the wooden house on wheels was
not remiss, but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner.</p>
<p>On being asked if it were he who had once rented the House to Let,
Grizzled Velveteen looked surprised, and said yes.&nbsp; Then his name
was Magsman?&nbsp; That was it, Toby Magsman&mdash;which lawfully christened
Robert; but called in the line, from a infant, Toby.&nbsp; There was
nothing agin Toby Magsman, he believed?&nbsp; If there was suspicion
of such&mdash;mention it!</p>
<p>There was no suspicion of such, he might rest assured.&nbsp; But,
some inquiries were making about that House, and would he object to
say why he left it?</p>
<p>Not at all; why should he?&nbsp; He left it, along of a Dwarf.</p>
<p>Along of a Dwarf?</p>
<p>Mr. Magsman repeated, deliberately and emphatically, Along of a Dwarf.</p>
<p>Might it be compatible with Mr. Magsman&rsquo;s inclination and convenience
to enter, as a favour, into a few particulars?</p>
<p>Mr. Magsman entered into the following particulars.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago, to begin with;&mdash;afore lotteries and
a deal more was done away with.&nbsp; Mr. Magsman was looking about
for a good pitch, and he see that house, and he says to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have you, if you&rsquo;re to be had.&nbsp; If money&rsquo;ll get you,
I&rsquo;ll have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbours cut up rough, and made complaints; but Mr. Magsman
don&rsquo;t know what they <i>would</i> have had.&nbsp; It was a lovely
thing.&nbsp; First of all, there was the canvass, representin the picter
of the Giant, in Spanish trunks and a ruff, who was himself half the
heighth of the house, and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole
on the roof, so that his Ed was coeval with the parapet.&nbsp; Then,
there was the canvass, representin the picter of the Albina lady, showing
her white air to the Army and Navy in correct uniform.&nbsp; Then, there
was the canvass, representin the picter of the Wild Indian a scalpin
a member of some foreign nation.&nbsp; Then, there was the canvass,
representin the picter of a child of a British Planter, seized by two
Boa Constrictors&mdash;not that <i>we</i> never had no child, nor no
Constrictors neither.&nbsp; Similarly, there was the canvass, representin
the picter of the Wild Ass of the Prairies&mdash;not that <i>we</i>
never had no wild asses, nor wouldn&rsquo;t have had &rsquo;em at a
gift.&nbsp; Last, there was the canvass, representin the picter of the
Dwarf, and like him too (considerin), with George the Fourth in such
a state of astonishment at him as His Majesty couldn&rsquo;t with his
utmost politeness and stoutness express.&nbsp; The front of the House
was so covered with canvasses, that there wasn&rsquo;t a spark of daylight
ever visible on that side.&nbsp; &ldquo;MAGSMAN&rsquo;S AMUSEMENTS,&rdquo;
fifteen foot long by two foot high, ran over the front door and parlour
winders.&nbsp; The passage was a Arbour of green baize and gardenstuff.&nbsp;
A barrel-organ performed there unceasing.&nbsp; And as to respectability,&mdash;if
threepence ain&rsquo;t respectable, what is?</p>
<p>But, the Dwarf is the principal article at present, and he was worth
the money.&nbsp; He was wrote up as MAJOR TPSCHOFFKI, OF THE IMPERIAL
BULGRADERIAN BRIGADE.&nbsp; Nobody couldn&rsquo;t pronounce the name,
and it never was intended anybody should.&nbsp; The public always turned
it, as a regular rule, into Chopski.&nbsp; In the line he was called
Chops; partly on that account, and partly because his real name, if
he ever had any real name (which was very dubious), was Stakes.</p>
<p>He was a uncommon small man, he really was.&nbsp; Certainly not so
small as he was made out to be, but where <i>is</i> your Dwarf as is?&nbsp;
He was a most uncommon small man, with a most uncommon large Ed; and
what he had inside that Ed, nobody ever knowed but himself: even supposin
himself to have ever took stock of it, which it would have been a stiff
job for even him to do.</p>
<p>The kindest little man as never growed!&nbsp; Spirited, but not proud.&nbsp;
When he travelled with the Spotted Baby&mdash;though he knowed himself
to be a nat&rsquo;ral Dwarf, and knowed the Baby&rsquo;s spots to be
put upon him artificial, he nursed that Baby like a mother.&nbsp; You
never heerd him give a ill-name to a Giant.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> allow
himself to break out into strong language respectin the Fat Lady from
Norfolk; but that was an affair of the &rsquo;art; and when a man&rsquo;s
&rsquo;art has been trifled with by a lady, and the preference giv to
a Indian, he ain&rsquo;t master of his actions.</p>
<p>He was always in love, of course; every human nat&rsquo;ral phenomenon
is.&nbsp; And he was always in love with a large woman; I never knowed
the Dwarf as could be got to love a small one.&nbsp; Which helps to
keep &rsquo;em the Curiosities they are.</p>
<p>One sing&rsquo;ler idea he had in that Ed of his, which must have
meant something, or it wouldn&rsquo;t have been there.&nbsp; It was
always his opinion that he was entitled to property.&nbsp; He never
would put his name to anything.&nbsp; He had been taught to write, by
the young man without arms, who got his living with his toes (quite
a writing master <i>he</i> was, and taught scores in the line), but
Chops would have starved to death, afore he&rsquo;d have gained a bit
of bread by putting his hand to a paper.&nbsp; This is the more curious
to bear in mind, because HE had no property, nor hope of property, except
his house and a sarser.&nbsp; When I say his house, I mean the box,
painted and got up outside like a reg&rsquo;lar six-roomer, that he
used to creep into, with a diamond ring (or quite as good to look at)
on his forefinger, and ring a little bell out of what the Public believed
to be the Drawing-room winder.&nbsp; And when I say a sarser, I mean
a Chaney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end
of every Entertainment.&nbsp; His cue for that, he took from me: &ldquo;Ladies
and gentlemen, the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan,
and retire behind the curtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he said anything important,
in private life, he mostly wound it up with this form of words, and
they was generally the last thing he said to me at night afore he went
to bed.</p>
<p>He had what I consider a fine mind&mdash;a poetic mind.&nbsp; His
ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he
sat upon a barrel-organ and had the handle turned.&nbsp; Arter the wibration
had run through him a little time, he would screech out, &ldquo;Toby,
I feel my property coming&mdash;grind away!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m counting
my guineas by thousands, Toby&mdash;grind away!&nbsp; Toby, I shall
be a man of fortun!&nbsp; I feel the Mint a jingling in me, Toby, and
I&rsquo;m swelling out into the Bank of England!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is
the influence of music on a poetic mind.&nbsp; Not that he was partial
to any other music but a barrel-organ; on the contrary, hated it.</p>
<p>He had a kind of a everlasting grudge agin the Public: which is a
thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of
it.&nbsp; What riled him most in the nater of his occupation was, that
it kep him out of Society.&nbsp; He was continiwally saying, &ldquo;Toby,
my ambition is, to go into Society.&nbsp; The curse of my position towards
the Public is, that it keeps me hout of Society.&nbsp; This don&rsquo;t
signify to a low beast of a Indian; he an&rsquo;t formed for Society.&nbsp;
This don&rsquo;t signify to a Spotted Baby; <i>he</i> an&rsquo;t formed
for Society.&mdash;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody never could make out what Chops done with his money.&nbsp;
He had a good salary, down on the drum every Saturday as the day came
round, besides having the run of his teeth&mdash;and he was a Woodpecker
to eat&mdash;but all Dwarfs are.&nbsp; The sarser was a little income,
bringing him in so many halfpence that he&rsquo;d carry &rsquo;em for
a week together, tied up in a pocket-handkercher.&nbsp; And yet he never
had money.&nbsp; And it couldn&rsquo;t be the Fat Lady from Norfolk,
as was once supposed; because it stands to reason that when you have
a animosity towards a Indian, which makes you grind your teeth at him
to his face, and which can hardly hold you from Goosing him audible
when he&rsquo;s going through his War-Dance&mdash;it stands to reason
you wouldn&rsquo;t under them circumstances deprive yourself, to support
that Indian in the lap of luxury.</p>
<p>Most unexpected, the mystery come out one day at Egham Races.&nbsp;
The Public was shy of bein pulled in, and Chops was ringin his little
bell out of his drawing-room winder, and was snarlin to me over his
shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back-door&mdash;for
he couldn&rsquo;t be shoved into his house without kneeling down, and
the premises wouldn&rsquo;t accommodate his legs&mdash;was snarlin,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a precious Public for you; why the Devil don&rsquo;t
they tumble up?&rdquo; when a man in the crowd holds up a carrier-pigeon,
and cries out, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any person here as has got a
ticket, the Lottery&rsquo;s just drawed, and the number as has come
up for the great prize is three, seven, forty-two!&nbsp; Three, seven,
forty-two!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was givin the man to the Furies myself, for
calling off the Public&rsquo;s attention&mdash;for the Public will turn
away, at any time, to look at anything in preference to the thing showed
&rsquo;em; and if you doubt it, get &rsquo;em together for any indiwidual
purpose on the face of the earth, and send only two people in late,
and see if the whole company an&rsquo;t far more interested in takin
particular notice of them two than of you&mdash;I say, I wasn&rsquo;t
best pleased with the man for callin out, and wasn&rsquo;t blessin him
in my own mind, when I see Chops&rsquo;s little bell fly out of winder
at a old lady, and he gets up and kicks his box over, exposin the whole
secret, and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to
me, &ldquo;Carry me into the wan, Toby, and throw a pail of water over
me or I&rsquo;m a dead man, for I&rsquo;ve come into my property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twelve thousand odd hundred pound, was Chops&rsquo;s winnins.&nbsp;
He had bought a half-ticket for the twenty-five thousand prize, and
it had come up.&nbsp; The first use he made of his property, was, to
offer to fight the Wild Indian for five hundred pound a side, him with
a poisoned darnin-needle and the Indian with a club; but the Indian
being in want of backers to that amount, it went no further.</p>
<p>Arter he had been mad for a week&mdash;in a state of mind, in short,
in which, if I had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes, I
believe he would have bust&mdash;but we kep the organ from him&mdash;Mr.
Chops come round, and behaved liberal and beautiful to all.&nbsp; He
then sent for a young man he knowed, as had a wery genteel appearance
and was a Bonnet at a gaming-booth (most respectable brought up, father
havin been imminent in the livery stable line but unfort&rsquo;nate
in a commercial crisis, through paintin a old gray, ginger-bay, and
sellin him with a Pedigree), and Mr. Chops said to this Bonnet, who
said his name was Normandy, which it wasn&rsquo;t:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normandy, I&rsquo;m a goin into Society.&nbsp; Will you go
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says Normandy: &ldquo;Do I understand you, Mr. Chops, to hintimate
that the &rsquo;ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; says Mr. Chops.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you shall
have a Princely allowance too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bonnet lifted Mr. Chops upon a chair, to shake hands with him,
and replied in poetry, with his eyes seemingly full of tears:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My boat is on the shore,<br />
And my bark is on the sea,<br />
And I do not ask for more,<br />
But I&rsquo;ll Go:&mdash;along with thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They went into Society, in a chay and four grays with silk jackets.&nbsp;
They took lodgings in Pall Mall, London, and they blazed away.</p>
<p>In consequence of a note that was brought to Bartlemy Fair in the
autumn of next year by a servant, most wonderful got up in milk-white
cords and tops, I cleaned myself and went to Pall Mall, one evening
appinted.&nbsp; The gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner, and Mr.
Chops&rsquo;s eyes was more fixed in that Ed of his than I thought good
for him.&nbsp; There was three of &rsquo;em (in company, I mean), and
I knowed the third well.&nbsp; When last met, he had on a white Roman
shirt, and a bishop&rsquo;s mitre covered with leopard-skin, and played
the clarionet all wrong, in a band at a Wild Beast Show.</p>
<p>This gent took on not to know me, and Mr. Chops said: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
this is a old friend of former days:&rdquo; and Normandy looked at me
through a eye-glass, and said, &ldquo;Magsman, glad to see you!&rdquo;&mdash;which
I&rsquo;ll take my oath he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Mr. Chops, to git him
convenient to the table, had his chair on a throne (much of the form
of George the Fourth&rsquo;s in the canvass), but he hardly appeared
to me to be King there in any other pint of view, for his two gentlemen
ordered about like Emperors.&nbsp; They was all dressed like May-Day&mdash;gorgeous!&mdash;And
as to Wine, they swam in all sorts.</p>
<p>I made the round of the bottles, first separate (to say I had done
it), and then mixed &rsquo;em all together (to say I had done it), and
then tried two of &rsquo;em as half-and-half, and then t&rsquo;other
two.&nbsp; Altogether, I passed a pleasin evenin, but with a tendency
to feel muddled, until I considered it good manners to get up and say,
&ldquo;Mr. Chops, the best of friends must part, I thank you for the
wariety of foreign drains you have stood so &rsquo;ansome, I looks towards
you in red wine, and I takes my leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Chops replied,
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just hitch me out of this over your right arm,
Magsman, and carry me down-stairs, I&rsquo;ll see you out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I said I couldn&rsquo;t think of such a thing, but he would have it,
so I lifted him off his throne.&nbsp; He smelt strong of Maideary, and
I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking as I carried him down that it was like
carrying a large bottle full of wine, with a rayther ugly stopper, a
good deal out of proportion.</p>
<p>When I set him on the door-mat in the hall, he kep me close to him
by holding on to my coat-collar, and he whispers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;appy, Magsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, Mr. Chops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t use me well.&nbsp; They an&rsquo;t grateful
to me.&nbsp; They puts me on the mantel-piece when I won&rsquo;t have
in more Champagne-wine, and they locks me in the sideboard when I won&rsquo;t
give up my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get rid of &rsquo;em, Mr. Chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in Society together, and
what would Society say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of Society!&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
talking about.&nbsp; When you have once gone into Society, you mustn&rsquo;t
come out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ll excuse the freedom, Mr. Chops,&rdquo;
were my remark, shaking my head grave, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a pity
you ever went in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Chops shook that deep Ed of his, to a surprisin extent, and slapped
it half a dozen times with his hand, and with more Wice than I thought
were in him.&nbsp; Then, he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow,
but you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Good-night, go along.&nbsp; Magsman,
the little man will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire
behind the curtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last I see of him on that occasion
was his tryin, on the extremest werge of insensibility, to climb up
the stairs, one by one, with his hands and knees.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d
have been much too steep for him, if he had been sober; but he wouldn&rsquo;t
be helped.</p>
<p>It warn&rsquo;t long after that, that I read in the newspaper of
Mr. Chops&rsquo;s being presented at court.&nbsp; It was printed, &ldquo;It
will be recollected&rdquo;&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve noticed in my life,
that it is sure to be printed that it <i>will</i> be recollected, whenever
it won&rsquo;t&mdash;&ldquo;that Mr. Chops is the individual of small
stature, whose brilliant success in the last State Lottery attracted
so much attention.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I says to myself, Such is Life!&nbsp;
He has been and done it in earnest at last.&nbsp; He has astonished
George the Fourth!</p>
<p>(On account of which, I had that canvass new-painted, him with a
bag of money in his hand, a presentin it to George the Fourth, and a
lady in Ostrich Feathers fallin in love with him in a bag-wig, sword,
and buckles correct.)</p>
<p>I took the House as is the subject of present inquiries&mdash;though
not the honour of bein acquainted&mdash;and I run Magsman&rsquo;s Amusements
in it thirteen months&mdash;sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
sometimes nothin particular, but always all the canvasses outside.&nbsp;
One night, when we had played the last company out, which was a shy
company, through its raining Heavens hard, I was takin a pipe in the
one pair back along with the young man with the toes, which I had taken
on for a month (though he never drawed&mdash;except on paper), and I
heard a kickin at the street door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; I says
to the young man, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;&nbsp; He rubs his eyebrows
with his toes, and he says, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Mr. Magsman&rdquo;&mdash;which
he never could imagine nothin, and was monotonous company.</p>
<p>The noise not leavin off, I laid down my pipe, and I took up a candle,
and I went down and opened the door.&nbsp; I looked out into the street;
but nothin could I see, and nothin was I aware of, until I turned round
quick, because some creetur run between my legs into the passage.&nbsp;
There was Mr. Chops!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;take me, on the old terms,
and you&rsquo;ve got me; if it&rsquo;s done, say done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was all of a maze, but I said, &ldquo;Done, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done to your done, and double done!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you got a bit of supper in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as we&rsquo;d
guzzled away at in Pall Mall, I was ashamed to offer him cold sassages
and gin-and-water; but he took &rsquo;em both and took &rsquo;em free;
havin a chair for his table, and sittin down at it on a stool, like
hold times.&nbsp; I, all of a maze all the while.</p>
<p>It was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages (beef, and
to the best of my calculations two pound and a quarter), that the wisdom
as was in that little man began to come out of him like prespiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;look upon me!&nbsp; You see
afore you, One as has both gone into Society and come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; You <i>are</i> out of it, Mr. Chops?&nbsp; How did
you get out, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SOLD OUT!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; You never saw the like of
the wisdom as his Ed expressed, when he made use of them two words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Magsman, I&rsquo;ll impart to you a discovery I&rsquo;ve
made.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wallable; it&rsquo;s cost twelve thousand five
hundred pound; it may do you good in life&mdash;The secret of this matter
is, that it ain&rsquo;t so much that a person goes into Society, as
that Society goes into a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly keepin up with his meanin, I shook my head, put on a
deep look, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Mr. Chops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, twitchin me by the leg, &ldquo;Society
has gone into me, to the tune of every penny of my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that I went pale, and though nat&rsquo;rally a bold speaker,
I couldn&rsquo;t hardly say, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Normandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolted.&nbsp; With the plate,&rdquo; said Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And t&rsquo;other one?&rdquo; meaning him as formerly wore
the bishop&rsquo;s mitre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolted.&nbsp; With the jewels,&rdquo; said Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>I sat down and looked at him, and he stood up and looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman,&rdquo; he says, and he seemed to myself to get wiser
as he got hoarser; &ldquo;Society, taken in the lump, is all dwarfs.&nbsp;
At the court of St. James&rsquo;s, they was all a doing my old business&mdash;all
a goin three times round the Cairawan, in the hold court-suits and properties.&nbsp;
Elsewheres, they was most of &rsquo;em ringin their little bells out
of make-believes.&nbsp; Everywheres, the sarser was a goin round.&nbsp;
Magsman, the sarser is the uniwersal Institution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived, you understand, that he was soured by his misfortunes,
and I felt for Mr. Chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to Fat Ladies,&rdquo; he says, giving his head a tremendious
one agin the wall, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s lots of <i>them</i> in Society,
and worse than the original.&nbsp; <i>Hers</i> was a outrage upon Taste&mdash;simply
a outrage upon Taste&mdash;awakenin contempt&mdash;carryin its own punishment
in the form of a Indian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he giv himself another tremendious
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;But <i>theirs</i>, Magsman, <i>theirs</i> is mercenary
outrages.&nbsp; Lay in Cashmeer shawls, buy bracelets, strew &rsquo;em
and a lot of &rsquo;andsome fans and things about your rooms, let it
be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire, and
the Fat Ladies that don&rsquo;t exhibit for so much down upon the drum,
will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you, whatever
you are.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll drill holes in your &rsquo;art, Magsman,
like a Cullender.&nbsp; And when you&rsquo;ve no more left to give,
they&rsquo;ll laugh at you to your face, and leave you to have your
bones picked dry by Wulturs, like the dead Wild Ass of the Prairies
that you deserve to be!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he giv himself the most tremendious
one of all, and dropped.</p>
<p>I thought he was gone.&nbsp; His Ed was so heavy, and he knocked
it so hard, and he fell so stoney, and the sassagerial disturbance in
him must have been so immense, that I thought he was gone.&nbsp; But,
he soon come round with care, and he sat up on the floor, and he said
to me, with wisdom comin out of his eyes, if ever it come:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magsman!&nbsp; The most material difference between the two
states of existence through which your unhappy friend has passed;&rdquo;
he reached out his poor little hand, and his tears dropped down on the
moustachio which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow,
but it is not in mortals to command success,&mdash;&ldquo;the difference
this.&nbsp; When I was out of Society, I was paid light for being seen.&nbsp;
When I went into Society, I paid heavy for being seen.&nbsp; I prefer
the former, even if I wasn&rsquo;t forced upon it.&nbsp; Give me out
through the trumpet, in the hold way, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arter that, he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been
iled all over.&nbsp; But the organ was kep from him, and no allusions
was ever made, when a company was in, to his property.&nbsp; He got
wiser every day; his views of Society and the Public was luminous, bewilderin,
awful; and his Ed got bigger and bigger as his Wisdom expanded it.</p>
<p>He took well, and pulled &rsquo;em in most excellent for nine weeks.&nbsp;
At the expiration of that period, when his Ed was a sight, he expressed
one evenin, the last Company havin been turned out, and the door shut,
a wish to have a little music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chops,&rdquo; I said (I never dropped the &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
with him; the world might do it, but not me); &ldquo;Mr. Chops, are
you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His answer was this: &ldquo;Toby, when next met with on the tramp,
I forgive her and the Indian.&nbsp; And I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with fear and trembling that I began to turn the handle; but
he sat like a lamb.&nbsp; I will be my belief to my dying day, that
I see his Ed expand as he sat; you may therefore judge how great his
thoughts was.&nbsp; He sat out all the changes, and then he come off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toby,&rdquo; he says, with a quiet smile, &ldquo;the little
man will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire behind
the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we called him in the morning, we found him gone into a much
better Society than mine or Pall Mall&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I giv Mr. Chops
as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power, followed myself as Chief,
and had the George the Fourth canvass carried first, in the form of
a banner.&nbsp; But, the House was so dismal arterwards, that I giv
it up, and took to the Wan again.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t triumph,&rdquo; said Jarber, folding up the
second manuscript, and looking hard at Trottle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
triumph over this worthy creature.&nbsp; I merely ask him if he is satisfied
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he be anything else?&rdquo; I said, answering for
Trottle, who sat obstinately silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;This time, Jarber,
you have not only read us a delightfully amusing story, but you have
also answered the question about the House.&nbsp; Of course it stands
empty now.&nbsp; Who would think of taking it after it had been turned
into a caravan?&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked at Trottle, as I said those last
words, and Jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let this excellent person speak,&rdquo; said Jarber.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were about to say, my good man?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wished to ask, sir,&rdquo; said Trottle doggedly, &ldquo;if
you could kindly oblige me with a date or two in connection with that
last story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A date!&rdquo; repeated Jarber.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does the
man want with dates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to know, with great respect,&rdquo; persisted
Trottle, &ldquo;if the person named Magsman was the last tenant who
lived in the House.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my opinion&mdash;if I may be excused
for giving it&mdash;that he most decidedly was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With those words, Trottle made a low bow, and quietly left the room.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Jarber, when we were left together, looked
sadly discomposed.&nbsp; He had evidently forgotten to inquire about
dates; and, in spite of his magnificent talk about his series of discoveries,
it was quite as plain that the two stories he had just read, had really
and truly exhausted his present stock.&nbsp; I thought myself bound,
in common gratitude, to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely
suggestion.&nbsp; So I proposed that he should come to tea again, on
the next Monday evening, the thirteenth, and should make such inquiries
in the meantime, as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of Trottle&rsquo;s
objection.</p>
<p>He gallantly kissed my hand, made a neat little speech of acknowledgment,
and took his leave.&nbsp; For the rest of the week I would not encourage
Trottle by allowing him to refer to the House at all.&nbsp; I suspected
he was making his own inquiries about dates, but I put no questions
to him.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, the thirteenth, that dear unfortunate Jarber came,
punctual to the appointed time.&nbsp; He looked so terribly harassed,
that he was really quite a spectacle of feebleness and fatigue.&nbsp;
I saw, at a glance, that the question of dates had gone against him,
that Mr. Magsman had not been the last tenant of the House, and that
the reason of its emptiness was still to seek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I have gone through,&rdquo; said Jarber, &ldquo;words
are not eloquent enough to tell.&nbsp; O Sophonisba, I have begun another
series of discoveries!&nbsp; Accept the last two as stories laid on
your shrine; and wait to blame me for leaving your curiosity unappeased,
until you have heard Number Three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Number Three looked like a very short manuscript, and I said as much.&nbsp;
Jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time.&nbsp;
In the course of his investigations he had stepped into the Circulating
Library, to seek for information on the one important subject.&nbsp;
All the Library-people knew about the House was, that a female relative
of the last tenant, as they believed, had, just after that tenant left,
sent a little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring
to events that had actually passed in the House; and which she wanted
the proprietor of the Library to publish.&nbsp; She had written no address
on her letter; and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be
given back to her (the publishing of poems not being in his line) when
she might call for it.&nbsp; She had never called for it; and the poem
had been lent to Jarber, at his express request, to read to me.</p>
<p>Before he began, I rang the bell for Trottle; being determined to
have him present at the new reading, as a wholesome check on his obstinacy.&nbsp;
To my surprise Peggy answered the bell, and told me, that Trottle had
stepped out without saying where.&nbsp; I instantly felt the strongest
possible conviction that he was at his old tricks: and that his stepping
out in the evening, without leave, meant&mdash;Philandering.</p>
<p>Controlling myself on my visitor&rsquo;s account, I dismissed Peggy,
stifled my indignation, and prepared, as politely as might be, to listen
to Jarber.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
